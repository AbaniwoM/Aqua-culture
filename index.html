          <h1 class="story-title">WHAT IS AQUACULTURE?</h1>
           <p class="story-text">The term aquaculture broadly refers to the cultivation of aquatic organisms in controlled aquatic environments for any commercial, recreational or public purpose. The breeding, rearing and harvesting of plants and animals takes place in all types of water environments including ponds, rivers, lakes, the ocean and man-made “closed” systems on land. We would be looking into what aquaculture is really about as we go further in the article.

      <p class="story-text"> Standard glass size of an aquarium glass is 10x7ft. Thickness is 6mm. Dimension for aquarium is 4x2ft. The Dulling machine is used to smoothen the edges of the glass. A  cutter is used to slice the glass according to specification. Different species of colourful aquarium fishes may be used. For example the Japanese Koi fish, a very elegant and attractive fish. The aquarium should be cleaned regularly. The water in the aquarium should be changed regularly.</p>

           <h1 class="story-title">AQUACULTURE MAINTENANCE!</h1>
            <p class="story-text">There should be proper aquaculture maintenance in order to prevent infection. Aquaskipping is the art of using available materials to beautify the aquarium. These materials may be artificial or natural. The two main areas of aquaculture are FISH KEEPING and COMMERCIAL REARING. Fish Keeping is caring for the ornamental fish as a hobby. Commercial rearing is breeding and marketing organisms for the fish keepers. Systems of ornamental aquarium was observed. They include: Water container/holding tank, Reliable water source, Equipment to maintain water quality such as Dissolved Oxygen meter, refractometer, Aerator and heater. Types of aquarium set-up was observed: Bowl aquarium, Wall aquarium and underground aquarium. Pleco is a natural pond cleaner while chemical filteration process is artificial.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">For species selection, we must observe: Temperature, Salinity tolerance, Size of fish, Feeding Habbit, Behaviour of fish. Maintenance of Aquarium can be:
               1) Daily (Feed, Monitor and lighting) 
               2) Weekly (Water testing and cleaning algae) 
               3) Monthly (Plant maintenance and Electrical inspection)

            <h1 class="story-title">FISH FEED PROCESSING</h1>
            <p class="story-text">Fish feed may be gotten from; Protein source, Groundnut cake meal (GNC), soya beans meal and company wastes such as Indomie production waste etc. Fingerlings need up to 80% protein consumption. They feed on powdery processed feed for easy digestion. As the fish gets matured, they are given a feed composition that is just enough to sustain them. Some equipments used in carring out fish processing are the mixer, digital measuring scale, Palletizer, Hammer hill and Extruder. It is important the fish feed is free from contamination.</p>
